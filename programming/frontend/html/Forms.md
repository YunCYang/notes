# Forms

## `<form>`

All of the attributes of `<form>` are optional, but it's standard practice to always set at least the *action* and *method* attributes.

```
<form action="/my-handling-form-page" method="post">
</form>
```
- The action attribute defines the location (URL) where the form's collected data should be sent when it is submitted.
- The method attribute defines which HTTP method to send the data with (usually get or post).
